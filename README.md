# blackjack-web-app

This independent project was designed and developed by Nick Marker in the Spring of 2023. It is a front-end only project, focusing on React, JavaScript and API interaction.

This project makes use of the "Deck of Cards API" in order to perform actions dealing with the members within a deck of cards. Additional information regarding this API or its directions for use can be found [here](https://deckofcardsapi.com/).

In the future I hope to create a backend for this application and deploy it for use. It was one of my first main projects using React, so the focus was primarily on the front-end.
